 I seek the means to fight injustice. To turn fear against those who prey on the fearful. I'm not wearing hockey pads. Swear to me! I will go back to Gotham and I will fight men Iike this but I will not become an executioner.

 This isn't a car. I'm not wearing hockey pads. Well, you see... I'm buying this hotel and setting some new rules about the pool area.

 No guns, no killing. The first time I stole so that I wouldn't starve, yes. I lost many assumptions about the simple nature of right and wrong. And when I traveled I learned the fear before a crime and the thrill of success. But I never became one of them.

 I will go back to Gotham and I will fight men Iike this but I will not become an executioner. Swear to me! I'll be standing where l belong. Between you and the peopIe of Gotham.

 It's not who I am underneath but what I do that defines me. It was a dog. It was a big dog.

 It was a dog. It was a big dog. Bats frighten me. It's time my enemies shared my dread. I'll be standing where l belong. Between you and the peopIe of Gotham.

 My anger outweights my guilt. Hero can be anyone. Even a man knowing something as simple and reassuring as putting a coat around a young boy shoulders to let him know the world hadn't ended.

 I can't do that as Bruce Wayne... as a man. I'm flesh and blood. I can be ignored, destroyed. But as a symbol, I can be incorruptible, I can be everlasting. It was a dog. It was a big dog.

 No guns, no killing. Someone like you. Someone who'll rattle the cages. No guns, no killing.

 It's not who I am underneath but what I do that defines me. I seek the means to fight injustice. To turn fear against those who prey on the fearful.
